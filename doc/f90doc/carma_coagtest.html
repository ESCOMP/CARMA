 This code is to demonstrate the CARMA coagulation routines
 in a test case based on Jacobson, "Modeling coagulation among
 particles of different composition and size," Atmospheric
 Environment 28, 1327-13338, 1994.  Upon execution, a text file
 (carma_coagtest.txt) is generated.  The text file can
 be read with the IDL procedure read_coagtest.pro.
